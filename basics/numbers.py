# Learning about numbers in python

"""
    we can perform any kind of arithmetic operations on numbers in python
    
    both int and float both used for number
"""

# Addition
print(2 + 4) # 6

# Subtraction
print(2 - 4) # -2

# Multiplication
print(2 * 4) # 8

# Division
print(2 / 4) # 0.5

# to the power of (Exponentials)
print(2 ** 3) # 8

# Interger division (double divide)
print(5 // 4) # 1

# Modulas (Remainder)
print(3 % 2) # 1


"""
    type() : it return the type of the value
"""

print(type(4)) # <class 'int'>
print(type(4.1)) # <class 'float'>

"""
    Python always choose higher precidence type for the resulting value
"""

# Ex: if we perform an addition between int and float the result will be float
print(2 + 2.5) # 4.5
