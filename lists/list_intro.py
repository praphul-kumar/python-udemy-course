# Exploring List

# List: Collection of items
# Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items


"""
Lists may be constructed in several ways:

    - Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list: []

    - Using square brackets, separating items with commas: [a], [a, b, c]

    - Using a list comprehension: [x for x in iterable]

    - Using the type constructor: list() or list(iterable)
